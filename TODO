Need "load data(...)".
The latter is like "data(...)" but loaded from a file (like "load(...)").

Vars need to be pushed/popped on fun calls.

While running the following:
    ./uwsgi/run --fus_execpost
And then running the following in separate terminal:
    ./uwsgi/curl_test "21"
We get this error:
    <no file>: row 1: col 1: split token "21": Lexer finished with status != done (OK)
