def vs module:
    def has code, module doesn't.
    both are "scopes" in the same way, that is, we should get rid of
    frame->module and just use frame->parent.

Need better debugging of compiler, similar to how state has nicer error messages now
(But even state's debug info is lacking -- should tell you row & col of an error!..)

Implement signatures...


Our current approach to name resolution, where we try to do evreything as soon as
possible and convert things to refs as needed, is overcomplicated.
Much easier to first generate the complete tree of frames, *then* resolve all
references.
We still need TYPE_REF, for "use" -- maybe *only* for "use"?..

Review compiler frame->row, frame->col stuff...
I had the following happen:

  Executing opcode < at byte 23/224
    In DEF 8 (apply_sounds) at row=8, col=0
    In MOD 1 (music) at row=2, col=3 [file:fus/music.fus]

...when apply_sounds should have been row=44, col=1.
For that matter, should col=0 ever be possible??
