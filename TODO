def vs module:
    def has code, module doesn't.
    both are "scopes" in the same way, that is, we should get rid of
    frame->module and just use frame->parent.

Need better debugging of compiler, similar to how state has nice error messages now

Implement signatures...


Our current approach to name resolution, where we try to do evreything as soon as
possible and convert things to refs as needed, is overcomplicated.
Much easier to first generate the complete tree of frames, *then* resolve all
references.
We still need TYPE_REF, for "use" -- maybe *only* for "use"?..
