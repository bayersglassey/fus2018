Implement "import" within a single file!
Then you can worry about imports between files.

And once import within single file works, easiest way to allow between
files is probably to have toplevel module names be filenames
(which is actually already the case!), and allow imports to specify
a filename:

    import def tostr(x -> s): "fus/format.fus" tostr
    import def format(a -> s): "fus/format.fus" format

...or:

    import module Format: "fus/format.fus"
    import def tostr(x -> s): Format tostr
    import def format(a -> s): Format format

That can be replaced later with a different interface, like having
"import format" look for format.fus or whatever.
