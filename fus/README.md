# FUS example code

Perhaps the best file in here for learning about Fus is [format.fus](/fus/format.fus).

Example usage::

    load: fus format
    def say_hello(s ->):
        ='name
        arr
            "Hello, ",
            'name,
            "!\n"
        @(format format) str_p


Another good file would be [tests.fus](/fus/tests.fus), which asserts the intended
behaviour of just about every feature in the language.
